    Kiwi is designed to be started up and then minimized with no intention of maximizing it again, all you need is to talk to her while she is minimized and unable to distract you.

    Kiwi can carry out complext tasks that will require a conversation to happen so when a complex task is called you should answer the follow up questions.
